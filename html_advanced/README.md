# HTML, advanced :sparkles:

HTML, or HyperText Markup language, is used to structure elements on a webpage. It is essentally the "bones" of a webpage, while CSS is a styling language which adds the beauty and "meat" to those bones. In this project at Holberton, we will be focusing on the structure and semantics of HTML. This project will be the base of a webpage built from scratch.

## Learning Objectives:
- What is HTML?
- How do you create an HTML page from a wireframe?
- What is a markup language?
- What is the DOM?
- What is an element / tag?
- What is an attribute?
- What is the purpose of each HTML tag?

## General Requirements:
- All your files should end with a new line
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
- You are **not allowed** to install, import or use external libraries. This website must be build with only HTML/CSS/JavaScript. No NodeJS, React, VueJS, Bootstrap, etc.
- Your code should be W3C compliant and validate with `W3C-Validator`
