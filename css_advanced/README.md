# CSS, advanced :sparkles:

HTML has laid the stepping stones of the website's structure, and it is the job of CSS to fill in the gaps with the content that the user sees. They bring out the best in eachother! In this project, we will create a CSS file containing our styles, and it will then be intermingled with our HTML file from the previous project. Here's where the real fun begins!

## Learning Objectives:
- What is CSS?
- How to add style to an element?
- What is a class?
- What is a selector?
- How to compute CSS Specificity Value?
- What are Box properties in CSS?
- How does the browser load a webpage?

## General Requirements:
- All your files should end with a new line
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
- You are **not allowed** to install, import or use external libraries. This website must be build with only HTML/CSS/JavaScript. No NodeJS, React, VueJS, Bootstrap, etc.
- Your code should be W3C compliant and validate with `W3C-Validator`
